            <h2><span class="tooltip-container">ACID<span class="tooltip-text">Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability</span></span> Properties</h2>
            <p>ACID properties are a set of guarantees that ensure database transactions are processed reliably. They are traditionally associated with relational database management systems (RDBMS).</p>

            <div class="property-definition" id="atomicity">
                <h3>Atomicity</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> An atomic transaction is an indivisible unit of work. It either completes entirely (all operations succeed) or fails entirely (all operations are rolled back, leaving the database state unchanged). There are no partial transactions.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>Banking Transaction.</strong> When you transfer money from Account A to Account B, this is an atomic operation. The system must debit Account A *and* credit Account B. If the debit succeeds but the credit fails (e.g., due to a system crash), the entire transaction must be rolled back, and the money returned to Account A. You wouldn't want the money to disappear into thin air.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="consistency_acid">
                <h3>Consistency</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> A transaction brings the database from one valid state to another. It ensures that all predefined rules, constraints, and triggers are maintained. Any data written to the database must be valid, and the transaction will not violate any integrity constraints (e.g., uniqueness, foreign key relationships, data type checks).</p>
                <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>Inventory Management in E-commerce.</strong> If an e-commerce platform has a rule that "stock quantity cannot be negative," a transaction attempting to sell an item when the stock is zero (or less than the order quantity) would be deemed inconsistent and rejected. This ensures that the inventory accurately reflects available products.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="isolation">
                <h3>Isolation</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Concurrent transactions execute as if they were executed sequentially. The intermediate state of a transaction is not visible to other transactions until the transaction is committed. This prevents anomalies like dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>Online Ticketing System.</strong> When multiple users try to book the last available seat for a concert simultaneously, isolation ensures that only one user's transaction successfully reserves the seat. Others will see that the seat is no longer available, even if their requests were sent almost at the same time. Each booking attempt is isolated from the others until one is committed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="durability">
                <h3>Durability</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Once a transaction has been committed, it will remain permanent, even in the event of system failures (e.g., power outages, crashes). The committed data is stored in non-volatile memory and can be recovered.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>Medical Records System.</strong> After a doctor updates a patient's medical history (e.g., adding a new diagnosis or prescription), that information must be permanently stored. Even if the hospital's server crashes immediately after the update, the durable property ensures that when the system restarts, the patient's updated record is intact and accessible.</p>

        <section id="cap" class="section">
            <h2><span class="tooltip-container">CAP<span class="tooltip-text">Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance</span></span> Theorem</h2>
            <p>The <span class="tooltip-container">CAP<span class="tooltip-text">Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance</span></span> theorem (often called Brewer's Theorem) states that a distributed data system cannot simultaneously guarantee all three of the following properties in the face of a network partition:</p>

            <div class="property-definition" id="cap_c">
                <h3>Consistency (Strong Consistency - different from ACID C)</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> All nodes in the system see the same data at the same time. After a write operation, any subsequent read operation across any node in the system will return the most recent written value.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="cap_a">
                <h3>Availability</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Every request receives a response (not necessarily the most recent data) without a guarantee of consistency, meaning the system is always operational for reads and writes.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="cap_p">
                <h3>Partition Tolerance</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The system continues to operate despite arbitrary failures of network links (network partitions) that result in some nodes being unable to communicate with others. In a distributed system, network partitions are inevitable.</p>
            <p>The <span class="tooltip-container">CAP<span class="tooltip-text">Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance</span></span> theorem dictates that you must choose to prioritize only two out of these three properties when a network partition occurs.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="cap_choices">
                <h3>CAP Theorem Choices</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>CA (Consistency & Availability) - Sacrifices Partition Tolerance:</strong>
                        <p>These systems are typically found in monolithic, non-distributed databases (like traditional single-node RDBMS). If a network partition occurs, the system essentially becomes unavailable to maintain consistency. This is less relevant for distributed Big Data systems, as partition tolerance is a must-have for them.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>CP (Consistency & Partition Tolerance) - Sacrifices Availability:</strong>
                        <p>In the event of a network partition, these systems will choose to halt operations on the affected partition or return an error to ensure that data remains consistent across all available nodes. Reads might fail or block until consistency can be guaranteed.</p>
                        <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>Financial Transaction Systems (e.g., Interbank Transfers).</strong> When absolute accuracy is paramount, banks often prioritize consistency. If a network partition prevents two data centers from communicating, the system might block new transactions or return errors until the partition is resolved and data consistency can be verified. This ensures no money is lost or duplicated due to inconsistent states. Apache HBase and MongoDB (in its default single-node or replica set configuration with strong consistency) can be considered CP systems.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>AP (Availability & Partition Tolerance) - Sacrifices Strong Consistency:</strong>
                        <p>These systems will continue to operate and respond to requests even during a network partition, potentially returning slightly stale data. They prioritize continuous operation over immediate global consistency. Data will eventually become consistent once the partition is resolved (eventual consistency).</p>
                        <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>Social Media Feeds (e.g., Facebook, Twitter).</strong> When you scroll through your feed, it's more important that you *see* something quickly than for every post to be immediately visible to everyone globally. If a server experiences a temporary network issue, the system will serve you the data it has, even if a very recent post from your friend on another server hasn't propagated yet. The system remains available, and consistency will eventually catch up. Cassandra, CouchDB, and DynamoDB are examples of AP systems.</p>

            <h2><span class="tooltip-container">BASE<span class="tooltip-text">Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent</span></span> Properties</h2>
            <p><span class="tooltip-container">BASE<span class="tooltip-text">Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent</span></span> is a set of properties often associated with NoSQL databases and distributed systems that prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strong consistency. It emerged as a counterpoint to <span class="tooltip-container">ACID<span class="tooltip-text">Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability</span></span>, reflecting the needs of large-scale, internet-facing applications.</p>

            <div class="property-definition" id="basically_available">
                <h3>Basically Available</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The system guarantees availability for all operations. This means the system will always respond to a request, even if some data might be stale or not perfectly synchronized. The focus is on providing a continuous service.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>E-commerce Product Catalog.</strong> An online retail website needs to be always available for customers to browse products. If a new product description is being updated on one server, the system will still serve the old description from another server rather than blocking the customer's request.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="soft_state">
                <h3>Soft State</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The state of the system can change over time, even without any input. This is due to the eventual consistency model, where data propagates through the system asynchronously. The data is not immediately consistent across all nodes.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>User Session Data in a Web Application.</strong> When a user logs in, their session information might be stored in a distributed cache. This state might be "soft" because it's constantly being updated and replicated, and temporary inconsistencies across cache nodes are acceptable as long as the user experience isn't severely impacted.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="eventually_consistent">
                <h3>Eventually Consistent</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> If no new updates are made to a given data item, eventually all accesses to that item will return the last updated value. There is no guarantee of immediate consistency, but given enough time, the data will converge to a consistent state across all replicas.</p>
                <p><strong>Industry Illustration:</strong> <strong>DNS (Domain Name System).</strong> When you register a new domain name or change its IP address, these changes don't propagate globally instantaneously. It takes time for DNS servers worldwide to update their caches and synchronize. During this propagation period, some users might get the old IP address while others get the new one. Eventually, all users will resolve to the new IP address.</p>

            <h2>IV. Other Relevant Properties for Big Data Systems</h2>
            <p>Beyond <span class="tooltip-container">ACID<span class="tooltip-text">Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability</span></span>, <span class="tooltip-container">CAP<span class="tooltip-text">Consistency, Availability, Partition Tolerance</span></span>, and <span class="tooltip-container">BASE<span class="tooltip-text">Basically Available, Soft State, Eventually Consistent</span></span>, several other properties are highly relevant and crucial for the effective design and operation of Big Data systems:</p>

            <div class="property-definition" id="scalability">
                <h3>Scalability</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a system to handle increasing amounts of data or workload by adding resources (e.g., adding more servers or nodes).</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Vertical Scalability (Scale-Up):</strong> Adding more CPU, RAM, or storage to an existing server. Limited by hardware.</li>
                    <li><strong>Horizontal Scalability (Scale-Out):</strong> Adding more machines to a distributed cluster. This is the primary mode of scaling for Big Data systems.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> A data analytics platform handling growing user traffic. Instead of upgrading a single powerful server (vertical), adding more commodity servers to a cluster (horizontal) allows it to handle petabytes of data and millions of concurrent queries.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="fault_tolerance">
                <h3>Fault Tolerance/Resilience</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a system to continue operating correctly even when parts of it fail (e.g., disk failure, network outage, server crash). This is achieved through redundancy, replication, and automatic failover mechanisms.</p>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) replicates data blocks across multiple nodes. If one node fails, the data is still accessible from other replicas, ensuring no data loss and continued processing.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="low_latency">
                <h3>Low Latency</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The speed at which a system can process and respond to data requests. In some Big Data scenarios, especially real-time analytics, low latency is critical.</p>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> A fraud detection system needs to analyze real-time credit card transactions with very low latency to identify and block fraudulent activities within milliseconds.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="high_throughput">
                <h3>High Throughput</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability of a system to process a large volume of data or transactions over a given period.</p>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> An IoT platform ingesting millions of sensor readings per second requires extremely high write throughput to handle the continuous stream of data.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="durability_extended">
                <h3>Durability (Extended)</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> While part of <span class="tooltip-container">ACID<span class="tooltip-text">Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability</span></span>, in Big Data, durability often extends to thinking about data archiving, backup, and disaster recovery strategies for massive datasets.</p>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Storing historical sales data for years in an immutable data lake (e.g., using S3 or Google Cloud Storage) with robust backup policies to ensure long-term availability for future analysis.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="security_privacy">
                <h3>Security and Privacy</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. This includes encryption (at rest and in transit), access control (role-based access control, attribute-based access control), auditing, and compliance with regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).</p>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> A healthcare Big Data platform must implement stringent security measures, including data anonymization, encryption, and strict access controls, to comply with patient privacy regulations.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="data_governance">
                <h3>Data Governance and Lineage</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Managing the availability, usability, integrity, and security of data throughout its lifecycle. Data lineage tracks the origin, transformations, and consumption of data, which is vital for compliance, debugging, and understanding data quality.</p>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> In a complex data pipeline for financial reporting, data governance tools track exactly where each piece of data came from, how it was transformed, and who accessed it, ensuring auditability and trustworthiness of reports.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="operational_simplicity">
                <h3>Operational Simplicity/Maintainability</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The ease with which a system can be deployed, monitored, managed, and debugged. Complex distributed systems can be challenging to operate.</p>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> Using managed cloud services (e.g., AWS EMR, Google Cloud Dataproc) for Hadoop or Spark clusters reduces the operational overhead compared to setting up and managing on-premise clusters.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="property-definition" id="extensibility">
                <h3>Extensibility</h3>
                <p><strong>Definition:</strong> The ability to easily add new features, data sources, or processing capabilities without significantly re-architecting the existing system.</p>
                <p><strong>Illustration:</strong> A Big Data analytics platform designed with a modular architecture allows new machine learning algorithms or data connectors to be plugged in without disrupting existing workflows.</p>
            </div>
            <p>These properties, when considered together, provide a comprehensive framework for evaluating and choosing the right technologies and architectural patterns for Big Data solutions. The specific prioritization of these properties will depend heavily on the unique requirements of each Big Data application.</p>
