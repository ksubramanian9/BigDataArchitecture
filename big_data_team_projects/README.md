# Big Data Project Instructions and Scoring Framework

## ðŸ“˜ Student Instruction Sheet

### 1. Project Overview
You will work in teams of 3 on one realistic Big Data scenario (allocated to you).  
Your project will simulate an **end-to-end Big Data pipeline**:  
**Ingestion â†’ Storage â†’ Processing â†’ Analytics â†’ Visualization â†’ Business Insights**.  

Duration: **4 weeks** (compressed milestones).

### 2. Technical Requirements
- **Tools / Frameworks**:  
  â€¢ Hadoop ecosystem: HDFS, Hive, Spark (mandatory)  
  â€¢ Kafka/Flume/Sqoop optional but encouraged  
  â€¢ **Open-source visualization only**: Apache Superset, Redash, Grafana, Kibana, Zeppelin/Jupyter  
- **Data**: Use provided synthetic data configs (or open datasets). Scale: 1â€“5 GB.  
- **Environment**: Local (Docker/VM) or Cloud (Databricks, EMR, GCP).

### 3. Execution Plan (Milestones)

| Week | Milestone              | Expected Outcome |
|------|------------------------|------------------|
| 1    | Setup & Data Acquisition | Install Hadoop ecosystem, finalize scenario, acquire/generate dataset |
| 2    | Ingestion & Storage    | Implement ingestion pipeline, load into HDFS Bronze/Silver/Gold, define Hive schema |
| 3    | Processing & Analytics | Develop Spark/MapReduce jobs for KPIs; optional MLlib/streaming |
| 4    | Insights & Visualization | Build dashboards (Superset/Redash/Grafana/Kibana/Zeppelin), deliver insights, report & demo |

---

### 4. Expected Outcomes
- End-to-end pipeline: ingestion â†’ HDFS â†’ Spark â†’ Hive â†’ dashboard  
- 3â€“5 KPIs per domain scenario  
- At least one actionable business recommendation  

---

### 5. Deliverables
- **Technical**: Code repo (ingestion, Spark jobs, schema)  
- **Business**: Dashboard + KPIs  
- **Report**: 12â€“15 pages  
- **Presentation**: Demo & slides (10 minutes)
