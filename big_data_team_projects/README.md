# Big Data Project Framework – Multi-Domain Scenarios

## 1. Project Theme

**“Big Data Applications Across Key Industries”**

Each team (3 students) selects **one scenario** from a curated list (10 domains × 7 = 70 scenarios).
All scenarios follow a common workflow:
**Data ingestion → Storage → Processing → Analytics → Visualization**.

Domains ensure variety (agriculture, healthcare, finance, retail, transport, energy, telecom, education, social media, government).

---

## 2. Project Structure

**Common Pipeline (for all teams):**

* **Data Sources** – Identify/download/generate open or synthetic datasets.
* **Data Ingestion** – Use Flume/Kafka/Sqoop/custom loaders.
* **Storage** – Land data in HDFS (Bronze → Silver → Gold zones). Use Hive/HBase as needed.
* **Processing** – Batch (MapReduce/Spark) + optional Streaming (Spark Structured Streaming).
* **Analytics** – Implement KPIs & domain-specific metrics.
* **Visualization** – Dashboards using Superset/Tableau/PowerBI/Zeppelin.

## 3. Milestones & Timeline (1 Week Each, 8 Weeks Total)

| **Week** | **Milestone**                | **Expected Outcome**                                                                                       |
| -------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1        | Setup & Data Acquisition     | Teams set up Hadoop ecosystem (HDFS, Hive, Spark). Select scenario + finalize datasets (real + synthetic). |
| 2        | Data Ingestion               | Load raw data via Kafka/Flume/Sqoop into HDFS (Bronze).                                                    |
| 3        | Data Storage                 | Organize Silver (cleaned) and Gold (aggregates) zones. Create Hive/NoSQL schemas.                          |
| 4        | Batch Processing             | Spark/MapReduce jobs for core KPIs.                                                                        |
| 5        | Streaming/Advanced Analytics | Implement streaming jobs (Spark Structured Streaming) or MLlib models.                                     |
| 6        | Business Use Case            | Develop the domain-specific solution (fraud detection, churn prediction, anomaly detection, etc.).         |
| 7        | Visualization                | Build dashboards in Superset/Tableau/Zeppelin.                                                             |
| 8        | Final Report & Demo          | Submit report (15–20 pages), present solution, and demo full pipeline.                                     |
