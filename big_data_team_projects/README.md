# Big Data Project Framework -- Multi-Domain Scenarios

**1. Project Theme**

**"Big Data Applications Across Key Industries"**

-   Each team (3 students) selects **one scenario** from the curated
    list (10 domains × 6 = 60 scenarios).

-   All scenarios share a **common Big Data workflow**: data ingestion →
    storage → processing → analytics → visualization.

-   Domains ensure variety (agriculture, healthcare, finance, retail,
    transport, energy, telecom, education, social media, government).

**2. Project Structure**

**Common Pipeline (for all teams)**

1.  **Data Sources** -- Identify/download/generate open or synthetic
    datasets.

2.  **Data Ingestion** -- Use Flume/Kafka/Sqoop/custom loaders.

3.  **Storage** -- Land data in HDFS (Bronze → Silver → Gold zones). Use
    Hive/HBase as needed.

4.  **Processing** -- Batch (MapReduce/Spark) + optional Streaming
    (Spark Structured Streaming).

5.  **Analytics** -- Implement KPIs & domain-specific metrics.

6.  **Visualization** -- Dashboards using
    Superset/Tableau/PowerBI/Zeppelin.

5.  **Transportation** -- Route optimization, breakdown/delay detection,
    demand forecasting, congestion prediction, revenue leakage,
    multi-modal integration.

6.  **Energy & Utilities** -- Load forecasting, predictive maintenance,
    theft detection, renewable forecasting, consumption patterns,
    dynamic pricing.

7.  **Telecom** -- Call drop analysis, churn, segmentation, SIM fraud,
    anomaly detection, social graph analysis.

8.  **Education** -- Performance prediction, adaptive learning, MOOC
    logs, skill gap, placement trends, resource allocation.

9.  **Social Media** -- Sentiment analysis, fake news detection,
    influencer analysis, video recommendations, toxic comment detection,
    churn analytics.

    welfare usage, disaster response, policy feedback sentiment.

**4. Milestones & Timeline (2 Months)**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Week**   **Milestone**      **Expected Outcome**
  ---------- ------------------ -----------------------------------------------
  1--2       **Setup & Data     Teams set up Hadoop ecosystem (HDFS, Hive,
             Acquisition**      Spark). Select scenario + finalize datasets

             Storage**          data → HDFS (Bronze). Organize Silver (cleaned)
                                and Gold (aggregates).

  5--6       **Processing &     Spark/MapReduce jobs to implement KPIs for
             Analytics**        scenario. Store results in Hive/NoSQL.
                                Optionally explore MLlib for
                                forecasting/classification.
